		Abayo is 28 years of age and is a middle class citizen. He works for a tax auditing company earning earning enough money to put food on the table and pay bills with a little extra for daily expenses and savings.
		He is a huge soccer fan and knows a lot of soccer teams' history.
			Abayo wakes up as early as 6 AM to get ready to go to work and he takes the by bus weekly to work.
		He partakes in sport betting a lot and hopes to win big one day. So he reads a lot of sport news on his Android mobile device, which has a touchscreen feature.
		 He checks for latest injury reports on key players of the sport team he plans to pick for either a win, lose or draw.
		 He also likes to chat with his friends who are also into sport betting for recommended picks and tips to get a second opinion of his sport bet picks.
		He loves statistics and reading charts which he finds more easy to read than an essay of a team rival history. Abayo takes only
		takes	calculated risks. He is a computer literate and he's tech savy so he isn't intimidated by any new technology.
			Abayo often multi-task and when he is at work he might get a tip on a game and wants to place the bet before the game starts.
			So he likes quick and precise navigations to his favorite soccer leagues.
